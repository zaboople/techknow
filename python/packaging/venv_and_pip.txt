# Create a virtual python environment in directory "myenv",
# which will appear in the current working directory
python -m venv myenv

# Activate it:
source myenv/Scripts/activate

# Your prompt will now include "(myenv)" in parentheses
# Using `which` should now indicate you are using the python, pip etc from myenv/Scripts
# instead of the main version:
which python
which pip

# Pip Install
pip install numpy
pip list
# You can now add "import numpy as np" in a script and start using numpy!

# Make a requirements file post-installation:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Bail out of virtual env
deactivate
