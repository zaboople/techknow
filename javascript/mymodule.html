            Must be sourced as type="module" or it will blow up. Also note that we
            cannot use any javascript functions in this file, exported or not, because
            it counts as a module, which is... strange. We can actually do a module in
            a <javascript type="module"> element and import other modules there, but
            we still can't call that javascript from onclick() and what-have-you, because
            onclick() and friends are locked out. We have to find the element and
            assign events to its elem.onclick= from inside our module.
