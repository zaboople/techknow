Vagrant works as long as you have a Vagrantfile in your current directory

#Start up your vm:
vagrant up

#SSH into it:
vagrant ssh

#Suspend your vm so it stops running:
vagrant suspend

#And start it back up:
vagrant resume

#Torch your vm (you can skip vagrant suspend):
vagrant destroy

#This setting fixes ms windows vagrants:
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
    v.customize ["setextradata", :id, "VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/v-root", "1"]
end
