You can make a container a flexbox container by doing this:

    display: flex;

You can add further container-level designations to control the flow of items after that.

# Container-level CSS designations

## JUSTIFY-CONTENT

Aligns items **horizontally** and accepts the following values:

    flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
    flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
    center: Items align at the center of the container.
    space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
    space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.


## ALIGN-ITEMS vs. ALIGN-CONTENT

Both set how multiple things are spaced apart from each other.

    - align-items determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container.
    - align-content determines the spacing between lines. When there is only one line, align-content has no effect.

    flex-start: Packed at the top of the container.
    flex-end: Packed at the bottom of the container.
    center: Packed at the vertical center of the container.
    space-between: Equal spacing between them.
    space-around: Equal spacing around them.
    stretch: Stretched to fit the container.


## FLEX-DIRECTION

Defines the direction items are placed in the container:

    row: The same as the text direction.
    row-reverse: Opposite to the text direction.
    column: Top to bottom.
    column-reverse: Bottom to top.

## FLEX-WRAP

Only useful when items overflow or at least threaten to.

    nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
    wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
    wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.

## FLEX-FLOW

Allows you to specify a flex-direction & flex-wrap both at the same time. Example:

    flex-flow: column wrap;


# CSS designations applied to items *within* a container


## ORDER

Changes the ordering of an element; everything defaults to zero, but you can move an element backwards and forwards by applying a negative or positive number to it.

## ALIGN-SELF

Accepts the same properties as align-items / align-content.
