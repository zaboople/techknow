This is just my repo o' knowledge, with lots of examples of programming, unix commands, database things, whatever.
Whenever I learn something that was a pain in the butt to learn, I shovel it in here, for future reference.
I can't vouch for everything in here; there may be better ways than whatever I recently squeezed out of a google or random flailing.
