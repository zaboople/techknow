dirs
  Gives a list of dirs on the stack
  -p Prints vertically instead of the stupid way
pushd
  With no arguments swaps the top two dirs (awesome)

  You can also give it +# and -#, like so
    pushd +1
    pushd -3
  The trick here is to look at the output of dirs,
  and pick your directory based on position. So if dirs says
    a b c d
  Then + counts from the left
    pushd +0 goes to a
    pushd +1 goes to b
    pushd +2 goes to c
    and so  on...
  But also
    pushd -0 goes to d
    pushd -1 goes to c
    pushd -2 goes to b
  Of course if you did dirs -p, + counts from the top down
  and - counts from the bottom up.
