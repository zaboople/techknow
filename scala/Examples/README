Currently on 688.

I wrote this while hacking my way through Programming in Scala, Edition 2. I tried to show examples of every concept I encountered, including a lot of things the book doesn't spell out completely. Scala has a lot of nuance and weirdness. Documenting everything is quite a challenge.

Most example files are standalone, so you can just type "scala foo/bar.scala" and watch it go. The demo directory has some larger programs that don't document a specific feature but are just showing off or something.

I last stopped at page 450, but I blew off Import & Package. I thought they were overcomplicated and I guess I was having a bad day and got irritable. They're good things, they just have too many features.
