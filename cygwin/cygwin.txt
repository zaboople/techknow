After installing, create a shortcut to mintty.exe and edit it like so:
  C:\Programs\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe /bin/bash -l
If you want to start in a particular directory, set the directory on the shortcut dialog and add this:
  C:\Programs\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe /bin/env CHERE_INVOKING=1 /bin/bash -l

If you are unhappy about the location it uses for your home directory you need to do this:
  Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf
  Add a db_home setting like:
    db_home=/my/home/directory
  However, note that this will apply to all users. The following will use your windows home directory via %H
    db_home:  /%H/cygwin
  Or use this to just specify your windows username
    db_home:  /%U/cygwin

Equivalent to the OSX/MacOS "open" command: cygstart
  cygstart http://microsoft.com
  cygstart foo.txt

I have had problems with losing permissions to my own files
  Edit /etc/fstab
  Change to:
    none /cygdrive cygdrive binary,noacl,posix=0,user 0 0
This is apparently caused by cygwin trying to interpret the owner of the C drive (which is usually administrator).

And finally the super-magic permission fix!
    setfacl -b .
