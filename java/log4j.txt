# Get log4j to up the reporting level for a particular package:
  # Everything is info:
  log4j.rootLogger=INFO
  # This piece of crap gets more:
  log4j.logger.org.apache.struts2=DEBUG

# This is another way to force control of logging, when it fights you
# We've defined a logger named "dinkus", so we're going to set its threshold.
# This doesn't give us thresholding by package, but fine, it helps shut everyone up:
log4j.appender.dinkus.threshold=INFO


# OKAY for log4j2, here is how you turn something off or restrict it:
# No debug/trace stuff:
logger.com.spud.name=com.spud
logger.com.spud.level=INFO
# Turn this one off:
logger.com.doo.bar.name=com.doo.bar
logger.com.doo.bar.level=OFF
# Errors/Fatal only:
logger.org.smut.dinkus.Flatulo.name=org.smut.dinkus.Flatulo
logger.org.smut.dinkus.Flatulo.level=ERROR
# Wrap it all up:
# Should be sorted from more specific to less specific; for example. com.example.test must come before com.example:
loggers=com.spud,com.doo.bar,org.smut.dinkus.Flatulo
