# Get log4j to up the reporting level for a particular package:
  # Everything is info:
  log4j.rootLogger=INFO
  # This piece of crap gets more:
  log4j.logger.org.apache.struts2=DEBUG
  
# This is another way to force control of logging, when it fights you
# We've defined a logger named "dinkus", so we're going to set its threshold.
# This doesn't give us thresholding by package, but fine, it helps shut everyone up:
log4j.appender.dinkus.threshold=INFO
