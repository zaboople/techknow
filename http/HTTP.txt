CORS - Cross Origin Request Sharing
  CORS is used when a page served by http://example.com wants to load resources from http://other.com.
  Client sends a normal request to http://other.com, but it should include an "Origin" header like
    Origin: http://example.com
  Server returns a response header, which will be one of:
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  The former case allows the original request; the latter promises to allow a request from *anywhere*
