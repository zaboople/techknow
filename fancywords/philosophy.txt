## The ologies:

Ontology: Metaphysics of the nature of being, OR a set of concepts and categories that illuminate the relations between aspects of a given domain.

Telology: The explanation of phenomena in terms of the *purpose* they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise OR the doctrine of design and purpose in the material world.

Epistemology: Examines the nature, origin, and limits of knowledge.

## Jonathan Haidt's Six Moral Dictums

Liberals mostly observe these and avoid the latter three:
- Care / Harm: We are obligated to care for each other and avoid harm to one another.
- Liberty / Oppression: We should give each other maximum freedom and not oppress people.
- Fairness / Cheating: Don't take what doesn't belong to you; pay what you owe.

Conservatives add these to the first three:
- Loyalty / Betrayal: Show loyalty to those who are loyal to you.
- Authority / Subversion: Respect leaders.
- Sanctity / Degradation: Some things are sacred and should be respected as such; disgust plays a role.
