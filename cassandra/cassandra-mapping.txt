3 types of model
  - Conceptual - entities & relationships
  - Logical
  - Physical

Mapping rules:
  - Entities and relationships: Figuring out what conceptual data we need
  - Equality search attributes: Columns that must come first in key
  - Inequality search attributes: Columns that come next
  - Ordering attributes: More columns
  - Key attributes: Extra columns we need to guarantee uniqueness and avoid upserts


  - 1:1 table: Pick your keys from either table
  - 1:N table: Need the keys from the N table
