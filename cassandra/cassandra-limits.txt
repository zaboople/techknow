Limits:
DO NOT use cassandra on SAN
3-5K transactions per core, 1-3 TB per node

Values per partition (cells per partition) < 2billion
  To calculate cells per partition:
    NV = (NR x (NC - NPK - NS)) + NS
    NV: Number of values aka cells
    NR: Number of rows
    NC: Total number of columns
    NPK: Number of primary key columns (because they don't count)
    NS: Number of static columns (because they don't count, except at the very end)

2.0 and earlier should be < 100MB per partition; 2.1 can do several 100's
  Calculating size of partition:
    Each Key column (partition & clustering columns) adds its own size
    Each Static column
      adds its own size
      adds an 8 byte timestamp
    Each cell
      adds its own data's size
      uses an 8-byte timestamp
      has a copy of the clustering columns, so adds their size too
      adds the size of its column name

As a result, extra key columns reduce the cells per partition (good) but increase the size of the partition because they get added to each cell.
