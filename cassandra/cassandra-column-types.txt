- Int is 32 bit

- UUID & TimeUUID
  - uuid() is a built-in function
  - uuid's apparently don't need to be quoted
  - now() gives you a timeuuid
  - sorting by timeuuid means sorting by actual time
  - note that third set of numbers in xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx
    is "4" for UUID, "1" for TimeUUID

- Timestamp is 64-bit number, since january 1 1970 000 GMT; displayed as GMT.

- Collection columns: Think java collections, e.g.
  SET<text>
  LIST<text>
  MAP<int, text>

- UDT User defined types - these can be used as column types:
    CREATE TYPE xx_address (
      street text, city text, zip_code int,
      phones SET<text>
    );
  But you gotta put "frozen" on 'em like this:
    CREATE TABLE xx_users (
      name text,
      user_address frozen <xx_address>,
      primary key(name)
    );

- Counter
  - Safe for concurrency; kind of like a semaphore
  - Increment & decrement only; cannot be assigned directly. Initializes to zero.
  - Apparently if one column is counter, all columns except the partition key must also be counter.

- Static
  - Apparently same across entire table. Bizarro.

- Tuple
  -?

- Secondary index?
  CREATE CUSTOM INDEX  fn_prefix ON cyclist_name (firstname)
    USING 'org.apache.cassandra.index.sasi.SASIIndex';
  SELECT * FROM cyclist_name WHERE firstname LIKE 'M%';
  SELECT * FROM cyclist_name WHERE firstname LIKE 'Mic%';
