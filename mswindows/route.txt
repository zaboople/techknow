1. To get your interface index:
  route print -4
Interfaces will be listed in the first half of output

2. This adds a gatweway of 192.168.13.2 subnet 136.157 to interface 10
  route -p add 136.157.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 192.168.13.2 if 10

3. I did this to fix my problems with a VPN server breaking the route to the host 207.207.36.151; my ISP modem assigned me a gateway of 192.168.1.1 before any VPN was going, so once VPN was working
    route ADD 207.207.36.151 MASK 255.255.255.255 192.168.1.1
