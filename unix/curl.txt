# Proxy:
curl --proxy



# Uploading a file but not multipart:
curl --data @file -X POST
    # Except you probably wanna do this instead because curl will rip out your linebreaks and other shenanigans
    curl --data-binary @file
    # Or even better is this:
    cat slop.txt | curl --data-binary @file -X POST http://....


# POST
#   When posting json data, always do
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
#   because otherwise curl tries to url-encode it

curl -d "param1=x&pram2=y"

-- Multipart forms
  - boundary: This is how you define separation of parts, but it's weird. If your boundary is "zzzzz", then
    - Used in between, you always add -- to the front, i.e. "--zzzzz"
    - Used at the end, you add -- to the front AND back, i.e. "--zzzzz--"
  - Content-Disposition: Note how we specify parameter names in the "name" field. Apparently you could also use "Form-Name: <name>" on its own line, but that never worked for me.

curl -v -X POST http://localhost:5000/import/v1/tables \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=zzzzz' \
  -d '--zzzzz
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="datadef"
Content-Type: application/x-yaml

descr: Data to store some stuff
fields:
  - name: FOO_ID
    type: int
  - name: FOO_NAME
    type: text
--zzzzz
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="table"
Content-Type: application/json

  "institution": "lager",
  "schema": "tardo",
  "table": "table_one",
  "iteration_type": "full",
  "processing": "full"

# OK That didn't work but this did:
