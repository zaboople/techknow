# Port forwarding for the client's sake:

# In this case
#    I want to get to lockedaway.com:8500
#    I'll expose it as 127.0.0.1:8501 on my own computer
#    I'll use accessible.com as my "proxy"
# Note that the 127.0.0.1 keeps other people from using my box as an open proxy; I could leave it off.
# Also the -nNT
ssh -nNT -L 127.0.0.1:8501:lockedaway.com:8500 myuser@accessible.com

# Socks proxy
# Here the socks proxy host is "myproxy" and the socks port is 3128
ssh -o ProxyCommand='nc -X connect -x myproxy:3128 %h %p'  root@172.202.148.226
