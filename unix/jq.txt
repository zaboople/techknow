# Get everything named bar under things named .foo
jq '.foo.bar'

# This will get the entire array named Clusters - all elements in the array
jq '.Clusters[]'

# This will get both attributes in the array of stuff under Clusters, but instead
# of pairing them up, it will split them out:
jq '.Clusters[]["MasterUsername","Tags"]'

# OK f that. Amazon makes it easy:
aws redshift describe-clusters --query 'Clusters[*].{user:MasterUsername,tags:Tags}' | less
