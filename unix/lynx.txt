# Un-crapping colors
In order to un-crap lynx colors, you can edit lynx.lss; "lss" stands for "lynx style sheet". This is usually in /etc.
In theory, your .lynxrc, env variables, -lss command-line option etc can all try to override the lynx style sheet, but none of this actually works. You just have to edit the /etc file.
