First add the script to /etc/init.d

Then do:
sudo update-rc.d <service> defaults

But I think that requires comments in the script detailing which run levels are what

# The systemctl way
systemctl stop service
systemctl start service
systemctl restart service

# If you're using journalctl for logs
# Follow
journalctl -fu service
# Static lising
journalctl -u service
